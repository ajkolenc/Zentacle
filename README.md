Generate spirals with a bunch of numbers! Made with Unity.

## General Notes
In the code, "Particle" refers to what are called "Spokes" in the UI.
I'm using the Moments Recorder to record gifs, modified to be single-threaded. 

Feel free to let me know if you have any feature requests or questions about the codebase!
